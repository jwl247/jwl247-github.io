Hello world, 
    another beautiful day, in the books. It's been awhile since I realized just how wonderful my life has been. The struggles are when my life was full of joy. I have struggled
alot over the years. Overcame obstacles personal, professional and worldly. So no matter what happens remember that it is truely how you carry yourself. Honor and respect are 
all but gone these days. HAPPINESS IS A CHOICE. the outcomes don't matter in the grand schema. life goes on sun still shines and struggles are temporary.
    i have been struggling with server set ups. so i thought I'd take a break and resist the urge to fake cuss the person who invented MySql. the creator of LVM's is a close second.


thank you for your time 
jerry
