HI GUYS, 
        Well, this is one for the ages. All of my functioning files were stolen or corrupted. I recovered because I have a lot of redundancy back up upon back up.
This is one lonely place when you're in trouble, nobody to talk to, nobody to scream at, not even a culprit to blame. So the great thing about adversity is that it puts you outside looking in at a project.
Adjust here, pivot there. Your better off most times i found myself facing challenges, i came out better than if I hadn't. we dont have problems, we have challenges.
I heard once that if you spend your life helping people find happiness, you will find yourself. I try to live that way. no matter the out come i give my best, and nobody can ask for more.
        Helix is no different. She has gained from the misfortune. more security, more features, and most of all, she's faster. That makes her even more Beautiful than before. She'll load your software fore you
point out your config conflicts and port conflicts, and put all your config files right in an easy-access folder to nano. She's going to be the most secure girl you've ever  had carry your information.
Anyway,just thought id drop a few lines. Happy Thanksgiving.
